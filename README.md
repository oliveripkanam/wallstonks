A simple, focused dashboard for watching public sentiment and macro context side‑by‑side—and a quick same‑day forecast for major indices (SPY/DIA). No fluff.

## What you’ll see

### Glossary & Methods
An interactive list of the signals used, with plain‑English definitions and the latest reading:
- News Sentiment (from major RSS headlines)
- Reddit Sentiment (from a few finance subreddits)
- Google Trends (simple week‑over‑week z‑scores for macro terms)
- ISM Manufacturing PMI and Consumer Confidence

Click any item to expand and see what it means and how it’s derived.

### Daily Features (top row)
Quick tiles that summarize today’s inputs:
- Reddit net sentiment
- Trends (inflation) z‑score
- PMI distance from neutral (50)
- Consumer Confidence level

These are the building blocks behind the forecast below.

### Daily Forecast (SPY / DIA)
A compact view of what today might look like using only public signals:
- Probability the index closes higher (“Prob up”)
- Expected move (open → close)
- Two rough ranges (50% and 80%)
- Top drivers with their push/pull

There’s also a short narrative that summarizes the overall tilt and drivers at a glance.

## How to use it
- Skim the Daily Features to get a feel for the day’s backdrop.
- Read the Forecast’s “Prob up”, expected move, and ranges for a quick baseline.
- Expand items in the Glossary whenever you want more context on a signal.

## Notes
- Built from public inputs; no price‑based predictive features.
- Signals are intentionally compact—use them as a nudge, not gospel.
- If anything looks off, refresh the page; it’s designed to be resilient and fast.
